Works on browsers that support getUserMedia  Try it out here!  To begin press 'Start theremin'.  To use the theremin with volume control (sometimes less accurate):  -Press 'Binary subtractor' and then press 'set background'  -Adjust the theshold slider until the frame is mostly black  -While holding your hand away from the camera, press 'set min' to set the position for low frequencies  -While holding your hand close to the camera, press 'set max' to set the position for high frequencies`  -To control the frequency, move your hand closer to/further from the camera.   -To control the volume, move your hand horizontally.  -To toggle volume control, press 'Volume Control(on/off)'.  -Try not to move your body too much as that interfers with the background subtractions.  -If you've changed locations, or the background behind you has substatially changed,   press 'set background' again. To use the theremin without volume control (more accurate, but not as cool. Also, doesn't work if background has too many objects)
